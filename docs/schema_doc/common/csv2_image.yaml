        This table is one of two tables used by the image distribution service to manage the movement of (kernal) images
        and ssh keypairs between clouds. The tables are:
        
        #. csv2_image_cache_

        #. csv2_image_pull_requests_

        #. csv2_image_transactions_

        The image distribution service (Glint)  ensures copies of objects are available on each cloud where they are 
        required by CSV2 users. The service provides User Interface (UI) displays to indicate current distribution as
        well as capabilities to remove or make additional copies on defined clouds.
