ec2_instance_types:
    Synopsis:
        This table lists a selection of instance types available on Amazon EC2.
        Only instance types from regions associated with clouds defined within CSV2
        groups are retrieved by the **csv2_ec2** poller and added to this table.

        This table is instrumental in CSV2's two stage Amazon EC2 Instance Type
        filtering process. Instance types within this table must be converted by
        the **csv2_ec2** poller to entries within the **cloud_flavors** table
        before they can be instantiated by CSV2.  For an in depth rational and
        description of the instance type filtering process, refer to the
        **csv2_instance_type_filters** table documentation.
