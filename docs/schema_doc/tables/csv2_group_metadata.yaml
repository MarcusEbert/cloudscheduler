csv2_group_metadata:
    Synopsis:
        In order for a Virtual Machine (VM) running on a cloud to be useful in the distributed
        cloud computing environment, it must be "contextualized". At a minumum, it must register
        with a condor central manager to receive jobs to execute. This contextualization is 
        achieved through metadata which is passed to **cloud-init** (see https://cloudinit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).
        The metadata to be used is saved as files within the database. Metadata can be defined
        in this table, at the group level (applies to all clouds within the group) or in the table
        csv2_cloud_metadata at the cloud level.
        All enabled metadata, both group and cloud, is collated in priority order and passed to cloud-init.


    Keys:

        group_name:
            Format: String(32)
            Synopsis:
                is the name of the group owning the metadata.

        metadata_name:
            Format: String(64)
            Synopsis:
                Is the arbitrary unique name (within the group) of the metadata.

    Columns:

        enabled:
            Format: Boolean
            Synopsis:
                If set to 0, the metadata file is disabled and will not be used.
                If set to 1, the metadata file is enabled and will be passed to cloud-init in 
                priority order.

        priority:
            Format: Integer
            Synopsis:
                Is a positive/negative integer specifying the metadata priority. 
                Lower numbers have highr priority. The default is 0.

        metadata:
            Format: String
            Synopsis:
                Is the metadata. It's format is dependent on the application that consumes it (see 
                "mime_type" below).

        mime_type:
            Format: String(128)
            Synopsis:
                Is a valid mime type (see the table csv2_mime_types) determining the way in
                which CSV2 handles this file.
                "Examples of mime_type are:"

                o cloud-config - yaml files passed to cloud-init.

                o ucernvm-config - a CernVM parameter file (see CernVM documentation).
