ec2_images:
    Synopsis:
        This table lists a selection of (kernel) images available on Amazon EC2.
        Only images belonging to owners specified in the **ec2_image_filters** table 
        are retrieved by the **csv2_ec2** poller and added to this table.

        This table is instrumental in CSV2's two stage Amazon EC2 Image filtering
        process. 
        Images within this table must be converted by the **csv2_ec2** poller to entries
        within the **cloud_images** table before they can be instantiated by CSV2.
        For an in depth rational and description of the image filtering process, refer to the 
        **csv2_image_filters** table documentation.

    Keys:

            Synopsis:
                Is the Amazon EC2 cloud/region this image is available on.

        id:
            Format: String(128)
            Synopsis:
                This is the unique ID of the image as defined by Amazon EC2.

        borrower_id:
            Format: String(32)
            Synopsis:
                Is a field indicating whether this (kernel) image has been specifically shared with your Amazon EC2 ID.
                If it has, this field will contain the Amazon account ID associated with the CSV2 cloud that retrieved
                this entry. Otherwise, it will contain the value 'not_shared'.

    Columns:

        owner_id:
            Format: String(32)
            Synopsis:
                Is the Amazon EC2 ID of the user owning this image. In order for you to see this image, they will have
                either shared it with your ID or made the image public.

        owner_alias:
            Format: String(64)
            Synopsis:
                Is the Amazon account alias that owns this image.

        disk_format:

            Synopsis:
                Is the type of disk required by this image, eg. ebs, instance-store, etc.

        size:

            Synopsis:
                Is the location of the image.

                The image location must be set by the owner and must be unique. 
                Since this information is normally very descriptive of what the image is,
                it is generally much more reliable than either the name or the description
                which are both optional.

        visibility:
            Format: String(128)
            Synopsis:
                Is a string indicating how you have access to this image.
