condor_machines:
    Synopsis:
        Maintaned by the csv2-machines poller, this table contains the current status of all HTCondor machines owned by CSV2. An HTCondor machine is the representation of an HTCondor prtition. Jobs run in partitions and a Single VM normally runs a primary or "Partitionable" partion to manage one or more "Dynamic" partitions used to run the jobs (one for each job). Therefore, there is a one to many relationship between CSV2 VMs and HTCondor machines. If a VM has no associated machines, it is said to be "unregistered". If it has only a primary partition, it is said to be"idle", A VM that has a primary partion and at least one dynamic partition is running a job and is sadi ti "running". The combination of the VM inforation together with the associated rows in the condor_machines table provides a very detailed picture of the state of a VM.
