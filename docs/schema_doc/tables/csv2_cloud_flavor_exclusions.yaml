csv2_cloud_flavor_exclusions:
    Synopsis:
        The concept of "flavor" comes from OpenStack (flavors) and Amazon EC2 (instance types) where the resources
        of a cloud, cores, RAM, disk, etc., are made available as named, pre-defined geometries. CSV2 retrieves the
        avaialable flavors from each cloud and makes them available for auto-selection based upon a job's specified
        resource requirements. Sometimes, it is desireable to ignore a flavor deemed unsuitable by criteria other 
        than cores, RAM, or disk. This table provides that capability.
