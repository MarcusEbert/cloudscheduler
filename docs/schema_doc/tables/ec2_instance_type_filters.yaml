        Rational and Description of CSV2's Two Stage Instance Type Filtering \\
        ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

        Amazon EC2 shares thousands of instance types (equivalent to OpenStack Flavors) per \\
        region. Many of these instance types have iidentical or similar resource configurations \\
        for different operating systems at differnet pricing.

        The fact that there are so many instance types of similar configuration can make \\
        the selection of a particular instance type with the appropriate configuration \\
        difficult. To ease this problem, CSV2 provides the following two stage filtering \\
        process:

        * Amazon EC2 Instance Type Information Retrieval:

        \\   The **csv2_ec2** poller retieves only those instance types corresponding to
        \\   the regions of Amazon EC2 clouds defined by users within CSV2 groups. The
        \\   instance types retrieved are placed in the **ec2_instance_types** table for inspection
        \\   through the User Interface (UI) and for additional filtering by the csv2_ec2
        \\   poller. This primary retieval process is run on a long cycle (the configurable
        \\   **sleep_interval_instance_type**) since the inventory of instance types 
        \\   remains fairly static.

        * Amazon EC2 Instance Type Filtering:
        
        \\   CSV2 will only instantiate flavors (instance types) listed in the **cloud_flavors**
        \\   table. The **csv2_ec2** poller must convert **ec2_instance_types** to **cloud_flavors**
        \\   and will apply all defined filters (see 'Columns' below) in the process.
        \\   The result is normally a small subset of flavors available for execution. This
        \\   filtering process is run on a short cycle defined by the configurable
        \\   **sleep_interval_filterer**.

        All filter specifications are joined with a logical **AND**."
