ec2_image_filters:
    Synopsis:
        "Amazon EC2 shares many thousands of (kernel) images owned and offered by their users. 
        Many of thses images should be of little interest since the owner could be
        anyone who uses Amazon EC2 and the content of their images could be unreliable
        or malicious.

        The fact that there so many images can make the selection of an image for execution
        difficult.
        To ease this problem, CSV2 provides the following filtering process:
        \n* The csv2_ec2 poller retieves only those images from the Amazon EC2 cloud that match
        owner IDs or owner aliases specified in the image filter (a row of this table) for
        the cloud. 
        The normally small subset of images retrieved are placed in the ec2_images table
        for inspection through the User Interface (UI) and for additional filtering by the 
        csv2_ec2 poller. 
        This primary retieval process is run on a long cycle (the configurable **sleep_interval_image**)
        since owner selection/images shared should be fairly static.
        \n* CSV2 will only instantiate images listed in the cloud_images table.
        The csv2_ec2 poller must convert ec2_images to cloud_images and when doing so 
        applies all defined filters, including 'like', 'not like', 'os', and 'architecture' in addition to
        the owner information, resulting in a smaller subset of image available for execution.
        This filtering process is run on a short cycle defined by the configurable **sleep_interval_filterer**. 

        All filter specifications are joined with a logical AND."
