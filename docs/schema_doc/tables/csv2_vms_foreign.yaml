csv2_vms_foreign:
    Synopsis:
        The cloud pollers maintain this table to keep track of used, unavailable resources on clouds.
        A CSV2 instance, say "MY_CSV2",  connects to clouds with user supplied credentials.
        If someone else, including another instance of CSV2,  connects to a cloud using the same credentials
        and instantiates VMs, the resources consumed will not be associated with MY_CSV2 but they will, however,
        be unavailable to MY_CSV2. 
        It is these "foreign" VMs that are being accounted for in this table.
