csv2_service_catalog:
    Synopsis:
        This service catalog table provides a registry for CSV2 processes to advertise their location.
        Since CSV2 processes are not reqired to run on a single machine, nor are they necessarily restricted
        to one instance, this table identifies what is runnong where.
        Processes register themselves when they start.

        Currently, the only use made of this information is by the scheduler which passes a subset of the
        information to jinja2 temples in preparation for VM contextualization.
