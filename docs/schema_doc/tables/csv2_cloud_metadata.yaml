csv2_cloud_metadata:
    Synopsis:
        In order for a Virtual Machine (VM) running on a cloud to be useful in the distributed
        cloud computing environment, it must be "contextualized". At a minumum, it must register
        with a condor central manager to receive jobs to execute. This contextualization is 
        achieved through metadata which is passed to **cloud-init** (`see <https://cloud-init.io/>`).
        The metadata to be used is saved as files within the database. Metadata can be defined
        at the group level (applies to all clouds within the group) or in this table at the cloud
        level. All enabled metadata, both group and cloud, is collated in priority order
        and passed to cloud-init.

    Keys:

        group_name:
            Format: String(32)
            Synopsis:
                Is the name of the owning group.

            Format: String(32)
            Synopsis:
                Is the name of the specific cloud to which this metadata file applies.

        metadata_name:
            Format: String(64)
            Synopsis:
                Is the metadata file name.

            Format: Boolean
            Synopsis:
                Use this file (enabled=1) or ignore this file (disabled=0).

            Format: Integer
            Synopsis:
                An integer (including negative integers) indicating the metadata file priority. Lower numbers have
