view_apel_accounting:
    Synopsis:
        "This view pulls information from three tables:

        * apel_accounting

        * cloud_flavors

        * cloud_images

        To present complete VM accounting information in a form suitable for
        presentation and for processing by external systems.

        The primary information source, **apel_accounting**, maintains an
        accounting record for each instantiated VM.  The records are initially
        created by a database trigger, **trigger_apel_accounting_add_vm**,
        when the CSV2 VM scheduler instantiates a VM and creates its entry in the
        **csv2_vms** table.  Subsequently, updates arrive from the VM via the
        **csv2_vm_data** poller. The record for any particular VM is completed
        by a second database trigger, **trigger_apel_accounting_del_vm**,
        following the terminationa of the VM and the removal of its record
        from the **csv2_vms** table. Finally, **apel_accounting** records 
        considered obsolete, those whose last update was more than the
        configurable value **apel_accounting_keep_alive_days** ago, are deleted
        by the **csv2_vm_data** poller."
