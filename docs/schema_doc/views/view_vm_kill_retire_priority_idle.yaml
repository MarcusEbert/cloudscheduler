view_vm_kill_retire_priority_idle:
    Synopsis:
        "REF=(common/view_vm_kill_retire)

        The view_vm_kill_retire_priority_idle creates a list of VMs to terminate and is used by the cloud 
        pollers to respond to quota and resource control changes. Sorted in descending priority order, each
        VM entry has running totals of both cores and RAM. By selecting the first N entries, known quantities
        of resources can be released, or by selecting the last N entries, known quantities of active resources
        can be retained.

        This view prioritizes idleness over the age of the VM. Idle VMs are set to the maximum possible
        age/priority. Otherwise the age/priority is set to the time in seconds since the last state change.
        The higher the age/priority, the lower the resource aggregates, and the earlier in the list the
        VM entry appears.
