view_vm_kill_retire_priority_idle:
    Synopsis:
        "REF=(views/view_vm_kill_retire_priority_age/0)

        This view prioritizes idleness over the age of the VM. Idle VMs are set to the
        maximum possible age/priority. Otherwise the age/priority is set to the time
        in seconds since the last state change. The higher the age/priority, the lower
        the resource aggregates, and the earlier in the list the VM entry appears.
