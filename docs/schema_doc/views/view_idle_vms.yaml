        REF=(common/view_vm_scheduling)

        The **view_idle_vms** is used by the VM scheduler to retrieve the list of VMs that need
        to be retired. The list will only contain entries for VMs that have already exceeded one
        of the time thresholds (see 'come_alive', 'job_alive', 'error_delay', and 'keep_alive'
        below). The VM scheduler will set the retire flag for each VMlisted.

    Columns:

        group_name:
            Format: String(32)
            Synopsis:
                Is the name of group owning the VM.

        cloud_name:
            Format: String(32)
            Synopsis:
                Is the name of cloud hosting the VM.

        come_alive:
            Format: String(128)
            Synopsis:
                Is the maximum time in seconds allowed for a VM between its instantiation and its registration with
                an HTCondor job scheduler. A VM exceeding this time may be failing to boot, or to contextualize, or
                to communicate via the network. Therefore, the VM should be terminated.

        job_alive:
            Format: String(128)
            Synopsis:
                Is the maximum time in seconds allowed for a VM between its registration and start of the first job
                on the VM. A VM exceeding this time has already booted, contextualized, communicated via the network,
                and registered but jobs are not starting within the required time threshold. Therefore, the VM is 
                probably misconfigured, possibly becuase of faulty contextualization files, and should be terminated.

        error_delay:
            Format: String(128)
            Synopsis:
                Is the maximum time in seconds allowed for a VM to remain in 'error' state. Typically, a VM will enter
                'error' state when there are insufficient resources on the cloud. Since 'error' states generally occur
                immediately after instatiation and some can be  transitory, a threshold time is allowed for VMs in 
                this state to maintain visibilty of this condition and allow possible recovery.

        keep_alive:
            Format: Integer
            Synopsis:
                Is the maximum time in seconds allowed for a VM to remain idle after it has completed a job.A Generally,
                a VM remains idle because either there are no more idle jobs in the queue that can be satisfied by this
                VM, or possibly because of contentention on the HTCondor job scheduler making it slow to start jobs.
                The 'keep_alive' time threshold is used to avoid unneccessary VM 'thrashing' (stopping and starting) of
                instances with the same characteristics. However, an excessively long threshold can waste precious
                resources and delay other jobs from running. 

        vmid:
            Format: String(128)
            Synopsis:
                Is the id of the VM that has exceeded a time threshold and needs to be terminated.

        hostname:
            Format: String(128)
            Synopsis:
                Is the short hostname of the VM that has exceeded a time threshold and needs to be terminated.

        primary_slots:
            Format: Integer
            Synopsis:
                Is the number of HTCondor primary slots currently active on the VM.

        dynamic_slots:
            Format: Integer
            Synopsis:
                Is the number of HTCondor dynamic slots currently active on the VM which is also the number of jobs
                currently running on the VM. This field should always be zero for any VM appearing on this list..

        retire:
            Format: Integer
            Synopsis:
                Is the retire flag for the VM. Any value greater than zero indicates that the retire/termination
                process is already in progress.

        terminate:
            Format: Integer
            Synopsis:
                Is the termination flag for the VM. Any value greater than zero indicates that the termination
                process is already in progress.

        poller_status:
            Format: String(12)
            Synopsis:
                Is the current state of the VM, eg. 'starting', 'unregistered', 'idle', 'running', 'retiring', etc.

        age:
            Format: Integer
            Synopsis:
                Is the time in seconds since the last state change. This value should exceed at least one of the four
                threshold times and, together with the 'primary_slots' and 'poller_status' fields, imply the reason 
                why termination is necessary.
