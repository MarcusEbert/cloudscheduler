        REF=(common/view_vm_scheduling)

        The **view_resource_contention** is used by the VM scheduler together with the
        **new_VMs_throttle** configuration option to govern the rate at which new VMs are
        instantiated on a cloud irrespective of the CSV2 group. The view provides a set
        of VM counters for each unique cloud, identified by the authurl. The VM scheduler
        limits the number of new VMs, those either 'starting' or 'unregistered', to the
        configuration value.)
