        "REF=(common/view_user_groups)

        The **view_user_groups** combines information from **csv2_user**, **csv2_groups**, 
        and **csv2_user_groups** to list one row for every user/group combination where the
        user is not currently associated with the group. The view is used to list those groups
        of which the user is not currently a member but to which they could be added.
