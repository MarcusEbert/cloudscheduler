view_vm_kill_retire_priority_age:
    Synopsis:
        "REF=(common/view_vm_kill_retire)

        The view_vm_kill_retire_priority_age creates a list of VMs to terminate and is used by the User 
        Interface (UI) processes to respond to resource control changes. Sorted in descending priority order,
        each VM entry has running totals of both cores and RAM. By selecting the first N entries, known
        quantities of resources can be released, or by selecting the last N entries, known quantities of
        active resources can be retained.

        This view prioritizes the age of the VM which is set to the time in seconds since the last stater
        change. The higher the age/priority, the lower the resource aggregates, and the earlier in the list
        the VM entry appears.
