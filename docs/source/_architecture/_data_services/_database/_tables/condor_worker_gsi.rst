Database Table: condor_worker_gsi
=================================

Maintained by the csv2-condor-gsi poller, this table maintains information about condor worker
ceretificates that are required by HTCondor instances that enable GSI authentication. For
such HTCondor instnces, valid certificsates are required for both the server and
any of its' workers. Without them, communication between the various HTCondor components
is impossible. CSV2 by defaut provides an HTCondor instance with GSI enabled
and it also provides tables, functions and processes to ease the management
of GSI credentials.

In addition to maintaining the condor worker certificate information in this table,
the csv2-condor-worker-gsi poller also maintains relevant server certificate information in the CSV2
table csv2_groups.

This informaaion is required of the local, default HTCondor server and any
remote, GSI enabled HTCondor servers and each of these servers will require
an instance of the csv2-htc-agent running on the hosting machinei.


Keys:
^^^^^

* **htcondor_fqdn** (String(128)):

      Is the Fully Qualified Domain Name (FQDN) of the HTCondor server.


Columns:
^^^^^^^^

* **worker_dn** (String(128)):

      Is the distinquished name of the condor worker cert of the corresponding
      HTCondor instance. This value is added to the configuration of the local
      default HTCondor instance automatically by CSV2 processes to allow remote condor instances
      communication privileges with local HTCondor components.

* **worker_eol** (Integer):

      Is the number of days left in the life of the condor
      worker certificate. CSV2 defines two thesholdsfor certificate validity: 'cert_days_left_bad' (default 7) and
      'cert_days_left_good' (default 28). When the certificate has less the cert_days_left_good remaining, a
      warning will be displayed on the status page. When the certifi cate
      has less the cert_days_left_bad remaining, an error will be displayed on the
      status page, and CSV2 will no longer manage VMs for this HTCondor
      instance.

* **worker_cert** (String):

      Is the gzipped/base64 representation of the worker certificate for an HTCondor instance.
      This value is passed to jinja2 metadata templates as the variable '{{
      cs_condorworker_cert }}' by the scheduler when preparing metadata files for VM contextualization.

* **worker_key** (String):

      Is the gzipped/base64 representation of the worker key for an HTCondor instance.
      This value is passed to jinja2 metadata templates as the variable '{{
      cs_condorworker_key }}' by the scheduler when preparing metadata files for VM contextualization.
