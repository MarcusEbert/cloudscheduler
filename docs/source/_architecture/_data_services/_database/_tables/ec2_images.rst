Database Table: ec2_images
==========================

This table lists images available on Amazon EC2 offered by owners specified
by CSV2 group members with defined 'amazon' clouds.


Keys:
^^^^^^^^

* **borrower_id** (String(32)):

      Is the Amazon account ID associated with the CSV2 cloud that retrieved
      this entry.

* **id** (String(128)):

      This is the unique ID of the image as defined by Amazon
      EC2.

* **region** (String(32)):

      Is the Amazon EC2 cloud/region this image is available on.


Columns:
^^^^^^^^

* **description** (String(256)):

      Is a description of the image, and is optionally set by the
      owner (see 'location' above).

* **disk_format** (String(128)):

      Is the type of disk required by this image, eg. ebs, instance-store,
      etc.

* **image_location** (String(512)):

      Is the location of the image.

      The image location must be set by the owner and must be
      unique. Since this information is normally very descriptive of what the image
      is, it is generally much more reliable than either the name or
      the description which are both optional.

* **last_updated** (Integer):

      Is the last time this information was updated.

* **name** (String(256)):

      Is the name of the image, and is optionally set by the
      owner (see 'location' above).

* **owner_alias** (String(64)):

      Is the Amazon account alias that owns this image.

* **owner_id** (String(32)):

      Is the Amazon account ID that owns this image.

* **size** (Integer):

      Is the number of gigabytes of disk required by this image.

* **visibility** (String(128)):

      Is a string indicating how you have access to this image. You
      either own it, or it is public, or it is shared with
      you.
