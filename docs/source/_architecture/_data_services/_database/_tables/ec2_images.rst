Database Table: ec2_images
==========================

This table lists a selection of (kernel) images available on Amazon EC2.
Only images belonging to owners specified in the **ec2_image_filters** table are retrieved
by the **csv2_ec2** poller and added to this table.

This table is instrumental in CSV2's two stage Amazon EC2 Image filtering
process. Images within this table must be converted by the **csv2_ec2** poller
to entries within the **cloud_images** table before they can be instantiated by
CSV2. For an in depth rational and description of the image filtering
process, refer to the **csv2_image_filters** table documentation.


Keys:
^^^^^

* **region** (String(32)):

      Is the Amazon EC2 cloud/region this image is available on.

* **id** (String(128)):

      This is the unique ID of the image as defined by Amazon
      EC2.

* **borrower_id** (String(32)):

      Is the Amazon account ID associated with the CSV2 cloud that retrieved
      this entry.


Columns:
^^^^^^^^

* **owner_id** (String(32)):

      Is the Amazon account ID that owns this image.

* **owner_alias** (String(64)):

      Is the Amazon account alias that owns this image.

* **disk_format** (String(128)):

      Is the type of disk required by this image, eg. ebs, instance-store,
      etc.

* **size** (Integer):

      Is the number of gigabytes of disk required by this image.

* **image_location** (String(512)):

      Is the location of the image.

      The image location must be set by the owner and must be
      unique. Since this information is normally very descriptive of what the image
      is, it is generally much more reliable than either the name or
      the description which are both optional.

* **visibility** (String(128)):

      Is a string indicating how you have access to this image. You
      either own it, or it is public, or it is shared with
      you.

* **name** (String(256)):

      Is the name of the image, and is optionally set by the
      owner (see 'location' above).

* **description** (String(256)):

      Is a description of the image, and is optionally set by the
      owner (see 'location' above).

* **last_updated** (Integer):

      Is the last time this information was updated.
