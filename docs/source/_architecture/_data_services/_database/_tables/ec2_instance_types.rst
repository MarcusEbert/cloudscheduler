Database Table: ec2_instance_types
==================================

This table lists a selection of instance types available on Amazon EC2.
Only instance types from regions associated with clouds defined within CSV2 groups
are retrieved by the **csv2_ec2** poller and added to this table.

This table is instrumental in CSV2's two stage Amazon EC2 Instance Type
filtering process. Instance types within this table must be converted by the
**csv2_ec2** poller to entries within the **cloud_flavors** table before they can be
instantiated by CSV2. For an in depth rational and description of the
instance type filtering process, refer to the **csv2_instance_type_filters** table documentation.


Keys:
^^^^^

* **instance_type** (String(32)):

      Is the instance type name.

* **operating_system** (String(32)):

      Is the operating system supported by this instance type.

* **region** (String(32)):

Columns:
^^^^^^^^

* **cores** (Integer):

      Is the number of cores that are offered by this instance type.

* **cost_per_hour** (Float):

      The decimal number given is the cost per hour for a running
      instance of this instance type stated in American dollars and cents.

* **instance_family** (String(32)):

      Is the Amazon EC2 classification of this instance type indicating the type
      of usage. Examples of familieas are 'Compute Optimized', 'Memory Optimized', etc.

* **memory** (Float):

      Is the total amount of RAM in gigabytes offered by this instance
      type.
