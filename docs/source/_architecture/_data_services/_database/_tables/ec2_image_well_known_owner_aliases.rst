Database Table: ec2_image_well_known_owner_aliases
==================================================

This table maintains aliases for Amazon EC2 accounts that share (kernel) images
and are considered reliable. In addition to a few well know reliable
providers, two special values are defined:

* self - images that your account owns

* shared - images that have been specifically shared with your account

Users may employ these aliases when selecting images for inclusion in their
cloud configuration. For more information about image filtering refer to the description
of the CSV2 table ec2_image_filters.

These aliases are used to populate fields of the User Interface (UI)
and during the image filtering process (for more information refer to the
description of the CSV2 table ec2_image_filters).
