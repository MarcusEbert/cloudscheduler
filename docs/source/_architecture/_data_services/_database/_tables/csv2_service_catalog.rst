Database Table: csv2_service_catalog
====================================

This service catalog table provides a registry for CSV2 processes to advertise
their location. Since CSV2 processes are not reqired to run on a
single machine, nor are they necessarily restricted to one instance, this table
identifies what is runnong where. Processes register themselves when they start.

Currently, the only use made of this information is by the scheduler
which passes a subset of the information to jinja2 temples in preparation
for VM contextualization.
