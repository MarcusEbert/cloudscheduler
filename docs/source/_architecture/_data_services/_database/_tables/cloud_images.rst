Database Table: cloud_images
============================

For each cloud defined within a group, CSV2 process will attempt to
retrieve configuration data to inform scheduling decisions and users. These configuration items
are set by the cloud administrators and not by CSV2. in oder
to change these values, you will to confer with the target cloud
support.

The information stored in this table reflect the VM images avialable on
the target cloud.
