Database Table: csv2_cloud_flavor_exclusions
============================================

The concept of "flavor" comes from OpenStack (flavors) and Amazon EC2 (instance
types) where the resources of a cloud, cores, RAM, disk, etc., are
made available as named, pre-defined geometries. CSV2 retrieves the avaialable flavors from
each cloud and makes them available for auto-selection based upon a job's
specified resource requirements. Sometimes, it is desireable to ignore a flavor deemed
unsuitable by criteria other than cores, RAM, or disk. This table provides
that capability.
