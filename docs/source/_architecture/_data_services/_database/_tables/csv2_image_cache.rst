Database Table: csv2_image_cache
================================

.. _csv2_image_cache: https://cloudscheduler.readthedocs.io/en/latest/_architecture/_data_services/_database/_tables/csv2_image_cache.html

.. _csv2_image_pull_requests: https://cloudscheduler.readthedocs.io/en/latest/_architecture/_data_services/_database/_tables/csv2_image_pull_requests.html

.. _csv2_image_transactions: https://cloudscheduler.readthedocs.io/en/latest/_architecture/_data_services/_database/_tables/csv2_image_transactions.html

This table is one of two tables used by the image distribution
service to manage the movement of (kernal) images and ssh keypairs between
clouds. The tables are:

#. csv2_image_cache_

#. csv2_image_pull_requests_

#. csv2_image_transactions_

The image distribution service (Glint) ensures copies of objects are available on
each cloud where they are required by CSV2 users. The service provides
User Interface (UI) displays to indicate current distribution as well as capabilities
to remove or make additional copies on defined clouds.

This table maintains a list of images that have been saved locally
on the the csv2 machine as the result of a direct upload
or as a part of a transfer request.
