Database Table: csv2_configuration
==================================

The **csv2_configuration** table maintains all the configuration information for CSV2. The only
configuration parameneters that are not stored within this table are those which
are needed before the database becomes available, eg. the location and credentials
of the database itself.

Configuration items are grouped by category. This allows CSV2 processes to read
by category only those items that are applicable. A single process may
retrieve zero, one, or more categories and may refresh the retrieved values
at any time.
