Database Table: csv2_cloud_aliases
==================================

This table allows users to create subsets of clouds within a CSV2
group and limit the execution of specific jobs to specific clouds by
use of the **target_alias** Job Description Lanuage (JDL) parameter. An alias may
contain one or more clouds and each cloud may be the member
of zero, one, or more aliases. Job's specifying a target alias will
be limited to clouds which are members of the specified alias, whereas
jobs not specify a target_lias are free to execute on any available
cloud within the CSV2 group.
