Database Table: csv2_vms_foreign
================================

The cloud pollers maintain this table to keep track of used, unavailable
resources on clouds. A CSV2 instance, say "MY_CSV2", connects to clouds with
user supplied credentials. If someone else, including another instance of CSV2, connects
to a cloud using the same credentials and instantiates VMs, the resources
consumed will not be associated with MY_CSV2 but they will, however, be
unavailable to MY_CSV2. It is these "foreign" VMs that are being accounted
for in this table.
