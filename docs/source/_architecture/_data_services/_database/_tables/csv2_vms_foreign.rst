Database Table: csv2_vms_foreign
================================

The cloud pollers maintain this table to keep track of used, unavailable
resources on clouds. A CSV2 instance, say "MY_CSV2", connects to clouds with
user supplied credentials. If someone else, including another instance of CSV2, connects
to a cloud using the same credentials and instantiates VMs, the resources
consumed will not be associated with MY_CSV2 but they will, however, be
unavailable to MY_CSV2. It is these "foreign" VMs that are being accounted
for in this table.


Keys:
^^^^^

* **authurl** (String(128)):

      Is the authoriztion URL of the cloud funning the foreign VMs.

* **region** (String(32)):

      Is the region within the cloud.

* **project** (String(32)):

      Is the project used to authenticate with the cloud in order to
      retrieve the VM list.

* **flavor_id** (String(128)):

      Is the flavor ID of the VMs being counted.


Columns:
^^^^^^^^

* **count** (Integer):

      Is the number of VMs on the cloud of this flavor ID.

* **cloud_type** (String(32)):

      Is the cloud type.
