Database Table: csv2_cloud_metadata
===================================

In order for a Virtual Machine (VM) running on a cloud to
be useful in the distributed cloud computing environment, it must be "contextualized".
At a minumum, it must register with a condor central manager to
receive jobs to execute. This contextualization is achieved through metadata which is
passed to **cloud-init** (see https://cloudinit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/). The metadata to be used is saved
as files within the database. Metadata can be defined at the group
level (applies to all clouds within the group) or specific to each
cloud. All enabled metadata, both group and cloud level metadata, is collated
in priority order and passed to cloud-init.

This table maintains cloud specific metadata.


Keys:
^^^^^

* **cloud_name** (String(32)):

      Is the name of the specific cloud to which this metadata file
      applies.

* **group_name** (String(32)):

      Is the name of the group owning the cloud and the metadata
      file.

* **metadata_name** (String(64)):

      Is the arbitrary unique name, within the group/cloud specific metadata files, of
      this metadata file.


Columns:
^^^^^^^^

* **enabled** (Boolean):

      If set to 0, the metadata file is disabled and will not
      be used. If set to 1, the metadata file is enabled and
      will be passed to cloud-init in priority order.

* **metadata** (String):

      Is the metadata. It's format is dependent on the application that consumes
      it (see "mime_type" below).

* **mime_type** (String(128)):

      Is a valid mime type determining the way in which CSV2 handles
      this file. Examples of mime_type are:

      o cloud-config - yaml files passed to cloud-init.

      o ucernvm-config - a CernVM parameter file (see CernVM documentation).

      For a complete list refer to the content of the CSV2 table
      csv2_mime_types.

* **priority** (Integer):

      An integer (including negative integers) indicating the metadata file priority. Lower numbers
      have highter priority and will be included earlier in the collation order.
