Database Table: csv2_cloud_metadata
===================================

In order for a Virtual Machine (VM) running on a cloud to
be useful in the distributed cloud computing environment, it must be "contextualized".
At a minumum, it must register with a condor central manager to
receive jobs to execute. This contextualization is achieved through metadata which is
passed to **cloud-init** (see https://cloudinit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/). The metadata to be used is saved
as files within the database. Metadata can be defined at the group
level (applies to all clouds within the group) or in this table
at the cloud level. All enabled metadata, both group and cloud, is
collated in priority order and passed to cloud-init.


Keys:
^^^^^^^^

* **cloud_name** (String(32)):

      Is the name of the specific cloud to which this metadata file
      applies.

* **group_name** (String(32)):

      Is the name of the group owning the metadata file.

* **metadata_name** (String(64)):

      Is the metadata file name.


Columns:
^^^^^^^^

* **enabled** (Boolean):

      Use this file (enabled=1) or ignore this file (disabled=0).

* **metadata** (String):

      Text of the actual metadata file.

* **mime_type** (String(128)):

      The type of metadata file. Vaid types include **cloud-config** and **ucernvm-config**.

* **priority** (Integer):

      An integer (including negative integers) indicating the metadata file priority. Lower numbers
      have highter priority and will be included earlier in the collation order.
