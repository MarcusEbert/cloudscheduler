Database Table: csv2_cloud_metadata
===================================

In order for a Virtual Machine (VM) running on a cloud to
be useful in the distributed cloud computing environment, it must be "contextualized".
At a minumum, it must register with a condor central manager to
receive jobs to execute. This contextualization is achieved through metadata which is
passed to **cloud-init** (`see <https://cloud-init.io/>`). The metadata to be used is saved
as files within the database. Metadata can be defined at the group
level (applies to all clouds within the group) or in this table
at the cloud level. All enabled metadata, both group and cloud, is
collated in priority order and passed to cloud-init.


Keys:
