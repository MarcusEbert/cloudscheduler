Database Table: csv2_group_metadata_exclusions
==============================================

The table provides group members additional control over the collation of metadata
in preparation for VM contextualization. i "There are two sources for metadata:"

1. Metadata defined at the group level is passed to all clouds
within the group, but

2. Metadata defined at the cloud level is specific to the cloud.

This table allows you define group metadata that is valid for every
cloud except cloud "X".
