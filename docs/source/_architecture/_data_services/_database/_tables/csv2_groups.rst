Database Table: csv2_groups
===========================

This table maintains CSV2 groups which is the principle authorization concept behind
managing cloud resources to enable job scheduling on one or more clouds.
A group may have zero to many members/users, each of which have
equal and full rights to manage and control the resources of the
group. A user that is not a member of a group has
no rights within that group but may be granted privileges for specific
actions regarding that group (eg. submit jobs for the group).

Groups can be added and deleted by super users. Super users are
not automatically added to any group but must be added to groups
just like any other user. Adding users to groups (and user definition)
is also done by super users.

When a group is defined, it is furnished with a default job
scheduler, and set of configurable system-wide job and VM defaults (see csv2_configuration).
Members of the group have the ability to modify any of these
settings.

Additionally, CSV2 automatically maintains a number of status fields iwithin the group
definition to assist operations and warn of possible failings. These values are
not modifiable by users.

* **group_name**:

   * Format: String(32)

^^^^^^^^

* **htcondor_container_hostname**:

   * Format: String(128)
