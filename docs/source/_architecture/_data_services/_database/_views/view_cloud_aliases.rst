Database View: view_cloud_aliases
=================================

The **csv2_cloud_aliases** table allows users to create subsets of clouds within a
CSV2 group and limit the execution of specific jobs to specific clouds
by use of the **target_alias** Job Description Lanuage (JDL) parameter. An alias
may contain one or more clouds and each cloud may be the
member of zero, one, or more aliases. Job's specifying a target alias
will be limited to clouds which are members of the specified alias,
whereas jobs not specifying a target alias are free to execute on
any available cloud within the CSV2 group.

This view presents the alias definitions in the **csv2_cloud_aliases** table in a
form suitable for the VM scheduler and for presentation in the user
interface.


Columns:
^^^^^^^^

* **group_name** (String(32)):

      Is the name of the CSV2 group that owns the alias.

* **alias_name** (String(32)):

      Is the unique name (within the group) of the alias.

* **clouds** (String):

      Is a comma separated list of cloud names associated with the alias
      name. Each cloud within the alias is also defined within the group.
