This view is one of a suite of related views used by
the User Interface (UI) processes to present Amazon EC2 information. The suite
includes:

#. view_ec2_images_

#. view_ec2_instance_types_

The **view_ec2_instance_types** presents the content of ec2_instance_types CSV2 table interpreting and appending
the memory_per_core and processor_manufacturer fields.


Columns:
^^^^^^^^

* **region** (String(32)):

      Is the Amazon EC2 region offering the instance type.

* **instance_type** (String(32)):

      Is the instance type name.

* **operating_system** (String(32)):

      Is the operating system supported by this instance type.

* **instance_family** (String(32)):

      Is the Amazon EC2 classification of this instance type indicating the type
      of usage. Examples of familieas are 'Compute Optimized', 'Memory Optimized', etc.

* **processor** (String(64)):

      Is the processor model name offered by this instance type.

* **storage** (String(32)):

      Is the type of storage that is supported by this instance type.
      Some storage types do not limit the size of the storage ('ebs',
      for example). Other types of storage are fixed and this field will
      also indicate the size.

* **cores** (Integer):

      Is the number of cores that are offered by this instance type.

* **memory** (Float):

      Is the total amount of RAM in gigabytes offered by this instance
      type.

* **cost_per_hour** (Float):

      The decimal number given is the cost per hour for a running
      instance of this instance type stated in American dollars and cents.

* **memory_per_core** (Float):

      This field is calculated as **memory** divided by **cores** and is provided
      as a feature of the instance type filtering process (see ec2_instance_type_filters_ for
      more information).

* **processor_manufacturer** (String(64)):

      This field is an interpretation of the **processor** field and is provided
      as a feature of the instance type filtering process (see ec2_instance_type_filters_ for
      more information).
