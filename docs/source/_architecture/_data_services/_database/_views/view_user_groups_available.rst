Database View: view_user_groups_available
=========================================

.. _view_user_groups: https://cloudscheduler.readthedocs.io/en/latest/_architecture/_data_services/_database/_views/view_user_groups.html

.. _view_user_groups_available: https://cloudscheduler.readthedocs.io/en/latest/_architecture/_data_services/_database/_views/view_user_groups_available.html

This view is one of a suite of related views supporting the
user management functions of CSV2. The suite includes:

#. view_user_groups_

#. view_user_groups_available_

The **view_user_groups** combines information from **csv2_user**, **csv2_groups**, and **csv2_user_groups** to list one
row for every user/group combination where the user is not currently associated
with the group. The view is used to list those groups of
which the user is not currently a member but to which they
could be added.


Columns:
^^^^^^^^

* **username** (String(32)):

      Is a defined user name.

* **group_name** (String(32)):

      Is a defined group name.

* **available** (String(32)):

      This column will be NULL because only 'available' groups are selected. For
      the unselected rows, this field contains the user name of a group
      member.
