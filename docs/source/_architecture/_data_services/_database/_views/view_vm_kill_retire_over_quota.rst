Database View: view_vm_kill_retire_over_quota
=============================================

This view is used by the cloud pollers to determine if any
group's clouds are running over their cores or RAM quotas. A cloud
managed by CSV2 may exceed quotas for the following reasons:

#. A user has reduced either the cores controls (**core_ctl** or **cores_softmax**)
or the RAM control (**ram_ctl**) below the resources currently consumed by VMs
instantiated by CSV2.

#. The number of foreign resources has increased (effectively reducing the CSV2
quota) for either cores or RAM so that the resources consumed by
CSV2 VMs exceed the new effective quotas.

The view will only present entries for clouds that are currently over
quota, and the pollers will respond by retiring and terminating VMs to
reduce the resources being consumed by CSV2. The order in which VM
are selected for termination is as follows:

#. Idle VMs will be terminated immediately, and then

#. the oldest running VMs, those with active jobs, will be retired
and, when idle, terminated.

The cloud pollers will terminate the minimum number of VMs to honour
the new limits.


Columns:
^^^^^^^^

* **group_name** (String(32)):

      Is the name of the group owning the cloud.

* **cloud_name** (String(32)):

      Is the name of the cloud.

* **cloud_type** (String(64)):

      Is the type of cloud (eg. openstack, amazon, etc.).

* **cores** (Integer):

      Is the current maximum number of cores that can be used by
      CSV2 on this group/cloud.

* **cores_ctl** (Integer):

      Is the current user setting of the cores control (slider) for the
      cloud and is one of settings used to determine the **cores_limit** (the
      maximum number of cores that may run for this group/cloud).

* **cores_softmax** (Integer):

      Is the current user setting of the cores soft quota (soft_max) for
      this cloud and is one of settings used to determine the **cores_limit**
      (the maximum number of cores that may run for this group/cloud)..

* **cores_max** (Integer):

      Is the current cores quota for this cloud set by the provider/administrator.
      It is one of the values used to determine the **cores_limit** (the
      maximum number of cores that may run for this group/cloud).

* **cores_native** (Integer):

      Is the total number of cores being used by all the VMs
      for this group/cloud.

* **cores_foreign** (Integer):

      Is the total number of cores running on this cloud but which
      do not belong to this group. Foreign cores can limit the number
      VMs a group can start.

* **ram** (Float):

      Is the current maximum size in kilobytes of RAM that can be
      used by CSV2 on this group/cloud.

* **ram_ctl** (Integer):

      Is the current user setting of the RAM control (slider) for the
      cloud and is one of settings used to determine the **ram_limit** (the
      maximum size in kilobytes of RAM that may run for this group/cloud).

* **ram_max** (Integer):

      Is the current RAM quota for this cloud set by the provider/administrator.
      It is one of the values used to determine the **ram_limit** (the
      maximum size in kilobytes of RAM that may run for this group/cloud).

* **ram_native** (Float):

      Is the total size in kilobytes of RAM being used by all
      the VMs for this group/cloud.

* **ram_foreign** (Float):

      Is the total size in kilobytes of RAM running on this cloud
      but which do not belong to this group. Foreign RAM can limit
      the number VMs a group can start.
