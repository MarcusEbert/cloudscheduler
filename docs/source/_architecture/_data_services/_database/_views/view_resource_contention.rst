This view is one of a suite of related views used by
the VM scheduler to control the management of VMs. The suite includes:

#. view_active_resource_shortfall_

#. view_available_resources_

#. view_groups_of_idle_jobs_

#. view_idle_vms_

#. view_metadata_collation_json_

#. view_resource_contention_

The **view_resource_contention** is used by the VM scheduler together with the **new_VMs_throttle**
configuration option to govern the rate at which new VMs are instantiated
on a cloud irrespective of the CSV2 group. The view provides a
set of VM counters for each unique cloud, identified by the authurl.
The VM scheduler limits the number of new VMs, those either 'starting'
or 'unregistered', to the configuration value.)
