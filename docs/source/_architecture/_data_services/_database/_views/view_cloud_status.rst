The **view_cloud_status** view details current cloud information including VM statistics HTCondor dynamic
slot totals, control settings and performance information. The view presents one row
per active group/cloud. A cloud is considered active if it is enabled
or if it is currently hosting VMs.

Columns:
^^^^^^^^

* **group_name** (String(32)):

      Is the name of the group owning the cloud.

* **cloud_name** (String(32)):

      Is the name of the cloud.

* **VMs** (Integer):

      Is the total number of VMs active for this group/cloud.

* **VMs_manual** (Integer):

      Is the number of VMs for this group/cloud that are in the
      'manual' state..

* **VMs_in_error** (Integer):

      Is the number of VMs for this group/cloud that are in the
      'error' state..

* **VMs_starting** (Integer):

      Is the number of VMs for this group/cloud that are in the
      'starting' state..

* **VMs_retiring** (Integer):

      Is the number of VMs for this group/cloud that are in the
      'retiring' state..

* **VMs_unregistered** (Integer):

      Is the number of VMs for this group/cloud that are in the
      'unregistered' state..

* **VMs_idle** (Integer):

      Is the number of VMs for this group/cloud that are in the
      'idle' state..

* **VMs_running** (Integer):

      Is the number of VMs for this group/cloud that are in the
      'running' state..

* **cores_native** (Integer):

      Is the total number of cores being used by all the VMs
      for this group/cloud.

* **ram_native** (Float):

      Is the total size in kilobytes of RAM being used by all
      the VMs for this group/cloud.

* **slot_count** (Integer):

      Is the total number of HTCondor dynamic slots running on all the
      VMs for this group/cloud.

      Dynamic slots are created by HTCondor to run jobs and only endure
      for the life of the jobs they run. The size of the
      slots, in terms of the number of cores and the amount of
      RAM is also dynamically determined by HTCondor depending on the jobs to
      be run.

      A single VM may run one or more slots and a single
      slot may run one or more jobs.

* **slot_core_count** (Integer):

      Is the total number of cores allocated to all the current dynamic
      slots for this group/cloud.

* **slot_idle_core_count** (Integer):

      Is the number of idle cores allocated to all the current dynamic
      slots for this group/cloud.

      A dynamic slot configured to run muliple jobs but currently running fewer
      jobs than the configuration allows will have idle cores.

* **Foreign_VMs** (Integer):

      Is the total number of VMs running on this cloud but which
      do not belong to this group. Foreign VMs can limit the number
      VMs a group can start.

* **enabled** (Boolean):

      Is a flag indicating whether the cloud is enabled (1) or disabled
      (0).

* **communication_up** (Boolean):

      This flag indicates whether CSV2 cloud pollers are able to communicate with
      the cloud. When a process fails to communicate with the cloud, it
      will set this flag to zero. Otherwise, this flag is set to
      one.

* **communication_rt** (Integer):

      Is a number of milliseconds indicating the responsiveness of the cloud. For
      each cloud type, a trivial request with a consistent response has been
      identified and is used to measure the 'request time' for the cloud.
      Normally, the request time is low and fairly consistent, but it is
      subject to both network and cloud congestion. A high number indicates a
      problem that should be invetigated.

* **cores_ctl** (Integer):

      Is the current user setting of the cores control (slider) for the
      cloud and is one of settings used to determine the **cores_limit** (the
      maximum number of cores that may run for this group/cloud).

* **cores_limit** (Integer):

      The **cores_limit** is the current maximum number of cores this group/cloud may
      run. This number is dynamic as it is affected by the user's
      cloud controls and by the number of foreign cores (cores being run
      by other groups or run by processes other than CSV2). It is
      calculated by taking the least of **core_ctl** or **core_soft_quota** minus **cores_foreign** or
      **cores_quota** minus **cores_foreign**.

* **VMs_quota** (Integer):

      Is the maximum number of VMs that can be running on this
      cloud.

* **VMs_native_foreign** (Integer):

      Is the total number of VMs running on this cloud, both for
      this group and for other users.

* **cores_quota** (Integer):

      Is the current cores quota for this cloud set by the provider/administrator.
      It is one of the values used to determine the **cores_limit** (the
      maximum number of cores that may run for this group/cloud).

* **cores_soft_quota** (Integer):

      Is the current user setting of the cores soft quota (soft_max) for
      this cloud and is one of settings used to determine the **cores_limit**
      (the maximum number of cores that may run for this group/cloud)..

* **cores_foreign** (Integer):

      Is the total number of cores running on this cloud but which
      do not belong to this group. Foreign cores can limit the number
      VMs a group can start.

* **cores_native_foreign** (Integer):

      Is the total number of cores running on this cloud, both for
      this group and for other users.

* **ram_ctl** (Integer):

      Is the current user setting of the RAM control (slider) for the
      cloud and is one of settings used to determine the **ram_limit** (the
      maximum size in kilobytes of RAM that may run for this group/cloud).

* **ram_limit** (Integer):

      The **ram_limit** is the current maximum size in kilobytes of RAM this
      group/cloud may run. This number is dynamic as it is affected by
      the user's cloud controls and by the size of foreign RAM (RAM
      being run by other groups or run by processes other than CSV2).
      It is calculated by taking the least of **ram_ctl** or **ram_quota** minus
      **ram_foreign**.

* **ram_quota** (Integer):

      Is the current RAM quota for this cloud set by the provider/administrator.
      It is one of the values used to determine the **ram_limit** (the
      maximum size in kilobytes of RAM that may run for this group/cloud).

* **ram_foreign** (Float):

      Is the total size in kilobytes of RAM running on this cloud
      but which do not belong to this group. Foreign RAM can limit
      the number VMs a group can start.

* **ram_native_foreign** (Float):

      Is the total size in kilobytes of RAM running on this cloud,
      both for this group and for other users.
