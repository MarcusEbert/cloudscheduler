Utility: cstrigger
==================

cstrigger reads the directory *.../cloudscheduler/schema/triggersr*' and updates the database
by recreating all defined triggers. It is normally invoked during the upgrade process by the
**db_upgrade** utility but can be run as a stand-alone utility.

Synopsis: cstrigger redefine
