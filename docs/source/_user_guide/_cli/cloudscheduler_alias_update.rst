**NAME**  
       **cloudscheduler  alias update** 
       - update alias definitions for the current 
       group.
 
**SYNOPSIS**  
       **cloudscheduler alias update mandatory_parameters** 
       [ *options*
       ...] 
 
**DESCRIPTION**  
       Modifies the alias definitions within the current group  by  adding  or
       deleting member clouds.  When the last cloud within an alias is deleted
       from the alias, then the alias is also removed  from  the  group.   All
       users within a group may update the aliases for that group.
 
**OPTIONS**  
   **Mandatory**  
       The following are mandatory parameters and must be specified:
 
       **-an** *name*,  **\\-\\-alias-name** *name* 
              The  alias  name.   The value for *name*
              must be one to thirty-two 
              characters, all lower case and numeric digits.
 
       **-cn** *name1[,name2,...nameN]*,  **\\-\\-cloud-name** *name1[,name2,...nameN]* 
              A comma seperated list of cloud names, each  previously  defined
              within the group.
 
   **Optional**  
       The following are optional parameters:
 
       **-co** *option*,  **\\-\\-cloud-option** *option* 
              The value for *option*
              must be either **add** 
              or **delete** . 
              If *option*
              is 
              **add** 
              the selected cloud will be added to the alias.  If *option*
              is 
              **delete** 
              the selected cloud will be deleted from the alias. If the 
              last cloud is deleted from an alias, the  specified  alias  will
              also be deleted from the group.
