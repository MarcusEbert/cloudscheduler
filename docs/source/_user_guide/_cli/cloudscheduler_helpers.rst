 **NAME** 
        **cloudscheduler  helpers** 
       -  cli helpers cloudscheduler version 2 (csv2)
       servers
 
 **SYNOPSIS** 
        **cloudscheduler helpers**  *action*
 
 **DESCRIPTION** 
       This object provides functions to aid in the use of this command.
 
 
 **ACTIONS** 
       The following actions are available for the  **helpers** 
       object:
 
        **check_documentation** 
              This action prints a  matrix  summarizing  the  completeness  of
               **cloudscheduler** 
              man page documentation.  It is used by developers
              to maintain up to date documentation.
 
        **generate_bash_completion_script** 
              This action creates or updates a bash completion script for  the
              **cloudscheduler**  command  in the user's home directory. It is
              performed automatically each time source for the  CLI  is  
              modified, but can also be run manually.
 
              The action performs the following:
 
              
o  If the directory does not already exist, creates 
              ~/.bash_completion.d
              
o  If  it  creates  /.bash_completion.d,  it  also  appends   to
              ~/.bash_completion   commands   to   'source'   all  scripts  in
              ~/.bash_completion.d
              
o Rewrites ~/.bash_completion.d/cloudscheduler.
 
              In order to use the new completion  script,  you  will  need  to
              start  a  new  terminal  session  or re-'source' 
              ~/.bash_completion.d/cloudscheduler.
 
 
        **print_json_syntax_tree** 
              This action prints a JSON string containing  the   **cloudscheduler** 
              command   syntax   tree.  It  is  used  by  developers  and  the
               **cli_doc_to_rst** 
              utility to furnish the **readthedocs** 
              web  service
              with the cloudscheduler man pages.
