=================================

 
 
 
**NAME**
       **cloudscheduler alias**
       - manage cloud aliases for the current group.
 
**SYNOPSIS**
       **cloudscheduler alias***action**mandatory_parameters*
       [*options*
       ...]
 
**DESCRIPTION**
       The  **alias**
       object allows for the creation and management of cloud
       subsets within a group.  Subsequently, jobs can be directed to execute  on
       a specific subset of clouds within a group by specifying an appropriate
       **target_alias**
       option inside the Job Definition Language (JDL) file  that
       is submitted to HTCondor.
 
**ACTIONS**
       For  information  on  the parameters associated with each **alias**
       action,
       refer to the documentation for that action (**cloudscheduler alias***action*
       **-H**).
       The following actions are available for the**alias**
       object:
 
       **add**
       Adds  a  new alias definition to the current group.  A group may
              have multiple alias definitions and each  alias  definition  may
              contain  one  or more clouds.  A single cloud can be a member of
              multiple aliases.  All users within a group may  create  aliases
              for the group.
 
       **list**
       Lists  all the alias definitions together with member clouds for
              the current group.  All users within a group may  list  and  use
              aliases.
 
       **update**
       Modifies  the  alias  definitions  within  the  current group by
              adding or deleting member clouds.  When the last cloud within an
              alias  is deleted from the alias, then the alias is also removed
              from the group.  All users within a group may update the aliases
              for that group.
