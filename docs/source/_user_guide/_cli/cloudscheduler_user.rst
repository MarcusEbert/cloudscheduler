**NAME**  
       **cloudscheduler  user** 
       - manage users on cloudscheduler version 2 (csv2) 
       servers
 
**SYNOPSIS**  
       **cloudscheduler user** *action* *mandatory_parameters*
       [ *options*
       ...] 
 
**DESCRIPTION**  
       The **user** 
       object  adds,  deletes,  lists,  and  updates  users  on  csv2 
       servers.   Each  user  can  be  assigned to groups, and will be able to
       manipulate the resources for the groups to  which  they  are  assigned.
       The **user** 
       object and actions are only available to privileged users. 
 
       An  unprivileged  user  will only be able to manage the defaults, 
       metadata, clouds, jobs, and VMs that are in groups that they are a part of.
       They will also be able to change their password.  A privileged user, in
       addition to everything an unprivileged user can  do,  can  also  manage
       users and groups.
 
**ACTIONS**  
       For  information  on  the  parameters associated with each **user** 
       action, 
       refer to the documentation for that action (**cloudscheduler user** *action* 
       **-H** ). 
       The following actions are available for the **user** 
       object: 
 
       **add** 
       The **cloudscheduler  user add** 
       action adds users to csv2 servers. 
              This action is only available to privileged users.   A  *username* 
              and  *password*
              is  required to create a user, but authentication 
              can be done with  a  X509  certificate  specified  by  *user_com-* 
              *mon_name*.  
 
       **delete** 
       The **cloudscheduler  user  delete** 
       action deletes users from csv2 
              servers.  The deleted user will be removed from all  groups  and
              will  no  longer be able to access the csv2 server.  This action
              is only available to privileged users.
 
       **list** 
       The **cloudscheduler user list** 
       action lists the  users  from  csv2 
              servers.   This  action  is  only available to privileged users.
              The list is displayed in a table and there are  several  options
              that change the format of the displayed table.
 
       **update** 
       The **cloudscheduler  user  update** 
       action  updates users on csv2 
              servers.  This action is only  available  to  privileged  users.
              The  *username*
              of  the  existing  user and at least one field to 
              update is required.  The **-gn** 
              and **-go** 
              parameters are used to 
              manage what groups a user is in.
