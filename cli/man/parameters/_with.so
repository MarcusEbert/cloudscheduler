\fB\-w \fItable1\fR[,table2,... tableN], \fB\-\-with \fItable1\fR[,table2,... tableN]
Specifies a comma-seperated list of names of optional tables to be displayed.
Some commands provide additional information which are not displayed unless specifically requested by name.
To determine the information returned by any particular command, use the \fB--view-columns\fR (\fB-VC\fR) option which provides a list of table numbers, tables names, and columns, high-lighting optional information.
This option accepts table numbers as well as tables names and the special value of \fBALL\fR which will display all optional information.

Default: None.
