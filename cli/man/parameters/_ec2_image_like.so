\fB\-il \fIstring1\fR[,string2,... stringN], \fB\-\-ec2-image-like \fIstring1\fR[,string2,... stringN]
Specifies a comma-seperated list of strings to be matched against the images location.
Images whose location match string1 \fBand\fR string2 \fBand\fR etc. are considered of interest and included in the list.
All other images will be filtered out by the ec2 object.

Why match the image location? Unlike the image name and the image description, the image location is mandatory and normally reflects
what the image is.

Default: None.
