\fB\-ioa \fIalias1\fR[,alias2,... aliasN], \fB\-\-ec2-image-owner-aliases \fIalias1\fR[,alias2,... aliasN]
Specifies a comma-seperated list of owner aliases of interest.
The \fBec2\fR object is to filter out images belonging to owners other than specified by this parameter or the \fB\-\-ec2-image-owner-ids\fR parameter.

Unlike other filters, this parameter and the \fB\-\-ec2-image-owner-ids\fR parameter also determine what is retrieved from Amazon EC2. Because there are 
so many images (millions?) available, only images belonging to the owners identified are retrieved.

The special aliases of "self" (images belonging to you) and "shared" (images specifically shared with you by someone else) are recommeded.

Default: (defined in the system configuration).
