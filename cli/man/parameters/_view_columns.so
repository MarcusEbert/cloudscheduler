\fB\-VC\fR, \fB\-\-view-columns\fR
View all table and column names associated with this command.
For each table of information returned by the command, a table number, table name, a possible "optional" designation, the "key" column (those that are displayed at the beginning of every segment) names, and all remaining column names are displayed.
This information is useful when creating views (see \fB--view\fR) or when selecting columns for comma separated output (see \fB--comma-separated-values\fR).
