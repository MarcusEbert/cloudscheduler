The \fBmetadata\fR object manages metadata and defaults for groups on \fBcloudscheduler\fR servers.
A group on a cloudscheduler server is analogous to a project on an OpenStack cloud and 
may have multiple users, anyone of whom may control the cloud resources for the group.
Each group has an associated list of metadata files that can be modified using the actions.
The metadata object and actions are available to all users.
Privileged users may add and delete groups with the \fBcloudscheduler group\fR object.
