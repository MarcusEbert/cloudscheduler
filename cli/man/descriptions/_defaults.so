This object manipulates groups of settings within a user's \fB~/.csv2\fR directory,
and provides actions to save, list, update, and delete settings for multiple servers.
A sub-directory is created for each server, and within that sub-directory, a single 
\fBsettings.yaml\fR file contains the default value for each parameter for that server.
The settings object and actions are available to all users.
