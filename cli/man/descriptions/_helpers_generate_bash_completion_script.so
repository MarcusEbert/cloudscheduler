.B generate_bash_completion_script
This action creates or updates a bash completion script for the **cloudscheduler** command
in the user's home directory. It is performed automatically each time source for the CLI
is modified, but can also be run manually.

The action performs the following:

o If the directory does not already exist, creates ~/.bash_completion.d
.br
o If it creates /.bash_completion.d, it also appends to ~/.bash_completion commands to 'source' all scripts in ~/.bash_completion.d
.br
o Rewrites ~/.bash_completion.d/cloudscheduler.

In order to use the new completion script, you will need to start a new terminal session or re-'source' ~/.bash_completion.d/cloudscheduler.
