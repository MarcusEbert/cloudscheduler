The \fBec2\fR object manages filters and lists information retrieved from Amazon EC2.
Seperate actions are defined for each kind of information that can be filtered/listed (see \fBACTIONS\fR, below).
When a user defines a cloud of cloud type "amazon", default filters for each action are also created.
These filters determine the information listed and control the selection of information mirrored in the 
corresponding CSV2 tables.
Users are able to modify filters, selecting the appropriate subset of information to be viewed and controlling
the resources available to CSV2.
