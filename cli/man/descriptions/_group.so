This object creates, lists, updates, and deletes groups on \fBcloudscheduler\fR servers.
A group on a cloudscheduler server is analogous to a project on an OpenStack cloud and 
may have multiple users, anyone of whom may control the cloud resources
for the group.
The group object and actions are only available to privileged users, except group defaults and metadata actions, which unprivileged users can modify for groups they are a part of.
