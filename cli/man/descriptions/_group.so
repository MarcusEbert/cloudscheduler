The \fBgroup\fR object creates, lists, updates, and deletes groups on \fBcloudscheduler\fR servers.
A group on a cloudscheduler server is analogous to a project on an OpenStack cloud and 
may have multiple users, anyone of whom may control the cloud resources for the group.
Each group has an associated list of metadata files that can be modified using the \fBmetadata-\fR actions.
The group object and actions are only available to privileged users.
Unprivileged users may update group defaults and metadata with the \fBcloudscheduler metadata\fR object.
