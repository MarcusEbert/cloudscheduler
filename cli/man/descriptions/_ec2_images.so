Amazon EC2 offers a vast collection of Virtual Machine (VM) images available for excution.
In addition to the public images offered by Amazon, any user can create and upload images, make them public, share them with other specific users, or keep them for private use.
With so many images to choose from, the process of image selection can be rather daunting.
The \fBec2 images\fR function of cloudscheduler version 2 (CSV2) provides a filtering system to ease the problem of finding appropriate images and reduce the overhead of managing the images of interest.
Since different images may be available to different regions, filtering is performed on a cloud by cloud basis.
It is therefore necessary to specify from which cloud connection the images are to be viewed.
