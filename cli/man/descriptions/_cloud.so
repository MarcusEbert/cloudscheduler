This object adds, deletes, lists, modifies, and shows the status of cloud resources
for clouds within the current group.
For each group, one or more cloud resources, both commercial and private, can be 
defined.
Defining cloud resouces for a group allows cloudscheduler to manage those resources
for the group, starting and stopping Virtual Machines (VMs) as required by the group's
job queue.
The cloud object and actions are available to all users.
