The \fBcloud\fR object adds, deletes, lists, modifies, and shows the status of clouds within the current group.
For each group, one or more clouds, both commercial and private, can be defined.
Defining a cloud allows cloudscheduler to manage the virtual machines(VMs) and condor job queue associated with that cloud.
Each cloud has an associated list of metadata files that can be modified using the \fBmetadata-\fR actions.
The cloud object and actions are available to all users, provided they are in the group the cloud definitions belong to.
