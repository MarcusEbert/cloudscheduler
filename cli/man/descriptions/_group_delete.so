The \fBcloudscheduler group delete\fR action deletes groups from csv2 servers.
This action is only available to privileged users.
All objects(group defaults, group metadata, cloud definitions, cloud metadata, jobs, and VMs) associated with the group will be deleted as well.
***PLANNED: If a group has running jobs or VMs the delete will fail.***
