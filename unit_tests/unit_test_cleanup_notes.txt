List of unit test files which have been updated as of December 2019

The unit tests were written and unused since 2017, as such some of them are depricated and require updating. One large change from 2017 to now is the default group setting for GET
requests. Before, cloudscheduler would keep track of the default group based on the previous request (every new request would update the default group to that group). Now the user sets their
default group and cloudscheduler does not change unless it is told to. Because of this some of the tests fail since they assume the default group has switched based on the last request when
it has not. This list documents which files HAVE NOT been changed. The files NOT on this list DO NOT NEED CHANGING.

Note: None of the cli tests were looked at as I assume they aren't issuing requests directly.
Note: As of writing this none of the fixed files have been tested, the fixes have been put in but the tests have not been run
